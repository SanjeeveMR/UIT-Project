              <p>Cricket is played by two teams of 11, with one side taking a turn to bat a ball and score runs, while the other team will bowl and field the ball to restrict the opposition from scoring. The main objective in cricket is to score as many runs as possible against the opponent. Before the match begins, the captain of both teams will toss a coin, with the winner of the toss being able to decide which team bats and fields first.Learn more about cricket, its rules, and famous players.</p>
